# Monitoring and Operational Runbook

This document provides operational guidance for monitoring agentic-perf's health, detecting issues early, and conducting periodic audits.

---

## Overview

Agentic-perf is a complex system with multiple agents, external integrations, and AI components. Effective monitoring requires tracking:

1. **System health** — Is the orchestrator running? Are services responsive?
2. **Agent performance** — Are agents completing tasks? How often do they fail?
3. **AI reliability** — Is the LLM producing correct output? Any drift or hallucinations?
4. **Resource usage** — Token spend, compute costs, convergence efficiency
5. **User satisfaction** — Feedback on results, perceived accuracy

---

## Key Metrics

### System Health

## Monitoring Dashboard Setup

### Real-Time Web UI Metrics
The web dashboard at `http://localhost:8090` shows:
- **Live ticket list** with status, token usage, age
- **System health** (orchestrator uptime, LLM API status)
- **Cost summary** (total spend, remaining budget)
- **Agent activity** (current active agents, recent completions)

View on a persistent monitor in your NOC/war room:
```bash
# Use a browser on a display, or pipe via ssh:
ssh monitor-host "watch -n 10 'curl -s http://localhost:8090/api/v1/health | jq .'"
```

### OpenTelemetry Export (Jaeger/Grafana)
If configured, metrics are exported to your observability stack:

```json
{
  "telemetry": {
    "otlp_exporter": {
      "endpoint": "http://jaeger-collector:4317",
      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer token"}
    }
  }
}
```

**Key traces to monitor:**
- `agentic_perf.agent.duration` — Agent execution time by agent type
- `agentic_perf.llm.tokens` — Token usage per ticket
- `agentic_perf.tool.duration` — Tool call latency by tool name
- `agentic_perf.orchestrator.poll_duration` — Polling cycle duration

**Queries in Jaeger:**
```
# Find slow agents
SELECT * FROM agentic_perf.agent.duration WHERE duration > 30m

# Find costly tickets
SELECT * FROM agentic_perf.llm.tokens WHERE total_tokens > 100k

# Tool failure rates
SELECT * FROM agentic_perf.tool.* WHERE error_count > 0
```

### Local Event Log Analysis
For real-time investigation without external tools:

```bash
# Stream event log as tickets complete
tail -f ~/.agentic-perf/logs/ticket-*.jsonl | \
  jq 'select(.event_type == "agent_finished") | {ticket_id, agent, duration_sec: .data.duration}'

# Count errors per agent
jq 'select(.event_type == "agent_error")' ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl | \
  jq -s 'group_by(.agent) | map({agent: .[0].agent, error_count: length})'

# Find slow tool calls
jq 'select(.event_type == "tool_result" and .data.duration > 30) | {ticket_id, tool: .data.tool, duration_sec: .data.duration}' ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl
```

## Alerting Rules

### Critical (Page on-call)
1. **Orchestrator down** — Confirm with `systemctl is-active agentic-perf-orchestrator`
   - Action: SSH to host, restart orchestrator, check logs for errors
   
2. **State store unresponsive** — `curl http://localhost:8090/health` fails
   - Action: Check disk space (`df ~/.agentic-perf`), restart state store
   
3. **LLM API error rate > 50%** — Check OTLP traces or event log
   - Action: Verify Anthropic API status, check API key, review error details
   
4. **Budget exceeded** — Event log shows `agent_paused: budget_limit`
   - Action: Investigate which tickets overspent; pause new submissions or increase budget
   
5. **Data corruption** — Event log or ticket file becomes unreadable
   - Action: Restore from backup; investigate disk health

### Warning (Log and review next business day)
1. **Agent failure rate > 5%** — More failures than normal
   - Action: Review failed agent transcripts; identify pattern (specific harness? provider?)
   
2. **HITL escalation rate > 30%** — Agents pausing too often
   - Action: Review agent prompts; may need refinement or updated skill docs
   
3. **Mean agent completion time > 30 min** — Agents are slow
   - Action: Check external system latency (SSH, QUADS API, AWS); review convergence loops
   
4. **Disk usage > 80%** — Running out of space
   - Action: Compress old closed tickets, archive to external storage, or expand filesystem
   
5. **User feedback negative rate > 20%** — More thumbs-down than normal
   - Action: Review negative feedback comments; identify common complaint patterns

### Informational (Log for trend analysis)
1. **New harness added** — Track first-use issues
2. **Agent prompt updated** — Monitor for regression vs improvement
3. **New resource provider integrated** — Track success rate
4. **Skill docs updated** — Check if agent behavior improves

## Weekly Review (Engineering Team)

### Metrics Review
```bash
# Week-to-date stats
echo "=== TICKETS PROCESSED ==="
find ~/.agentic-perf/logs -name "ticket-*.jsonl" -mtime -7 | wc -l

echo "=== AGENT SUCCESS RATE ==="
jq 'select(.event_type == "agent_finished") | .data.status' ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl | \
  sort | uniq -c

echo "=== AVG TOKENS PER TICKET ==="
jq 'select(.event_type == "llm_usage") | .data.output_tokens' ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl | \
  jq -s 'add / length'

echo "=== HITL ESCALATIONS ==="
jq 'select(.event_type == "transition" and .data.to_status == "awaiting_customer_guidance") | .ticket_id' \
  ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl | sort | uniq | wc -l
```

### Issue Triage
- Review failed tickets: What went wrong? Pattern or one-off?
- Review slow tickets: Why did they take > 30 min?
- Review negative feedback: What are users complaining about?
- Review new errors in event log: Unseen error patterns?

### Action Items
- Update skill docs if agents misunderstand capability
- Refine agent prompts if they make recurring mistakes
- Tighten command policy if agents attempt unauthorized operations
- Increase budget if users are hitting limits on legitimate work

---

## Monthly Audit (Management/Compliance)

### AI Safety Audit
1. **Drift Detection** — Are agents behaving differently than last month?
   - Compare error rates, feedback scores, convergence rates
   - Any suspicious patterns (e.g., increased hallucinations)?
   
2. **User Feedback Analysis** — Aggregate and categorize feedback
   - What are the top complaints?
   - What are the top praise items?
   - Any consistency issues (e.g., specific harness always fails)?
   
3. **Permissions Audit** — Review who can do what
   - List all users and their roles
   - Verify no privilege creep (agents accessing unexpected tools)
   - Verify no orphaned admin accounts
   
4. **Accuracy Spot-Check** — Randomly sample 5 completed tickets
   - Did the benchmark run as described?
   - Did the analysis match the data?
   - Would you trust the recommendation?
   
5. **Security Review** — Scan for credential leaks
   - Grep event logs for SSH key patterns: `grep -E "BEGIN.*KEY|-----" ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl`
   - Grep for common secret patterns: `grep -E "password|api.?key|token" ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl`
   - Action: If found, rotate credentials immediately and redact logs

### Cost Analysis
```bash
# Total LLM spend
jq '.data.cost_usd' ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl 2>/dev/null | \
  jq -s 'add | "Total spend: $\(.)"'

# Cost per ticket type
jq 'select(.event_type == "submit_triage") | .ticket_id as $id | 
    {ticket: $id, benchmark: .data.benchmark}' ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl | \
  jq -s 'group_by(.benchmark) | 
         map({benchmark: .[0].benchmark, count: length, tickets: map(.ticket)})'
```

### Resource Provider Health
- **QUADS**: Success rate? Avg wait time? Any API errors?
- **AWS**: Cost overruns? Instance launch failures? Termination issues?
- **PSAP**: Cluster availability? Kubeconfig delivery latency?

### SLA Tracking
- Avg time to triage: ___ minutes
- Avg time to provision: ___ minutes
- Avg time to run benchmark: ___ minutes
- Avg time to review: ___ minutes
- **Total end-to-end:** ___ minutes

Compare to SLA targets. If trending up, investigate why.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Symptom: Orchestrator consuming high CPU
**Possible causes:**
- LLM polling loop running too fast
- Database query inefficiency
- Infinite tool-call loop

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Check orchestrator log
tail -100 ~/.agentic-perf/logs/orchestrator.log | grep -E "ERROR|WARNING"

# Check for runaway agents
ps aux | grep agentic-perf

# Check poll interval config
grep poll_interval ~/.agentic-perf/config.json
```

**Fix:**
- Increase `poll_interval` in config (default: 3 seconds)
- Restart orchestrator: `systemctl restart agentic-perf-orchestrator`

### Symptom: Tickets stuck at `awaiting_customer_guidance`
**Possible causes:**
- Agent asked a question; user forgot to reply
- Agent error; escalated to human

**Investigation:**
```bash
agentic-perf show <ticket_id>  # Check custom_fields for agent message
```

**Fix:**
```bash
agentic-perf reply <ticket_id> "your clarification"
```

### Symptom: LLM API errors spiking
**Possible causes:**
- Rate limit hit
- API credentials expired
- Anthropic API outage

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Check recent LLM errors
jq 'select(.event_type == "agent_error" and .data.error_type == "llm") | .data' \
  ~/.agentic-perf/logs/*.jsonl | tail -10
```

**Fix:**
- Verify API key in `~/.agentic-perf/secrets/`
- Check Anthropic API status page
- If rate limited, stagger submissions or add delay between agents

### Symptom: Results look wrong or incomplete
**Possible causes:**
- Benchmark configuration was incorrect
- Data collection interrupted
- Harness schema changed

**Investigation:**
```bash
# Check the run configuration
agentic-perf show <ticket_id> | grep -A 100 "runfile"

# Check benchmark logs on test system
ssh user@host "tail -100 /opt/crucible/.../run.log"
```

**Fix:**
- Review configuration; resubmit with corrected parameters
- Check test system state; may need to restart harness
- Verify harness version matches expected schema

## Performance Optimization

### If agents are slow:
1. Increase parallelism (currently 1 agent per ticket in sequence)
2. Cache benchmark schema locally (avoid repeated downloads)
3. Pre-warm LLM context (cache system prompts in OTLP)

### If token usage is high:
1. Reduce prompt verbosity (remove examples)
2. Cache skill docs in agent context
3. Use smaller models for triage/review phases

### If QUADS reservation is slow:
1. Use AWS for faster turnaround
2. Request dedicated capacity reservation
3. Pre-allocate hosts in off-hours

### If benchmarks timeout:
1. Increase timeout thresholds in orchestrator config
2. Use QUADS hosts (more stable) vs AWS (more variable)
3. Reduce benchmark duration (faster feedback loop)

## Runbook: Adding a New Harness

When adding a new benchmark harness:

1. **Deploy harness** to test system
2. **Create skill provider** (`providers/skills/{harness}/`) with:
   - Harness schema (run-file format)
   - Platform contract (pre/post conditions)
   - Configuration guide
3. **Test with agents**: Submit 5 test tickets, monitor for issues
4. **Monitor closely first 2 weeks**: High alert threshold
5. **After 2 weeks**: Promote to production, normal monitoring

---

## Runbook: Emergency Incident

### Agent Stuck in Infinite Loop
1. **Immediate**: Hard-stop the ticket: `agentic-perf emergency-stop --hard`
2. **Pause new submissions**: Temporarily disable new ticket ingestion
3. **Investigate**: Review event log, identify root cause
4. **Fix**: Update agent prompt or skill docs to prevent recurrence
5. **Resume**: Re-enable submissions, resubmit failed ticket

### LLM API Outage
1. **Pause new submissions**: No new work while API is down
2. **Wait for recovery**: Check Anthropic status page
3. **Resume**: When API is healthy, resume normal operations

### Data Corruption
1. **Isolate**: Stop orchestrator immediately
2. **Backup**: `cp -r ~/.agentic-perf ~/.agentic-perf.backup-$(date +%s)`
3. **Restore**: From known-good backup or git repository
4. **Verify**: Checksums match, event log is intact
5. **Resume**: Start orchestrator, monitor closely

### Security Incident (Credential Leak)
1. **Alert**: Notify security team immediately
2. **Revoke**: Rotate leaked credentials (SSH keys, API tokens)
3. **Audit**: Grep logs for evidence of misuse
4. **Redact**: Remove or encrypt sensitive logs
5. **Update**: Push new credentials to all agents
6. **Monitor**: Watch for suspicious activity
