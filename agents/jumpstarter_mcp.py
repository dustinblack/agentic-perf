"""Jumpstarter MCP attachment for agents.

Conditionally connects the Jumpstarter MCP server to an agent's
MCP client when the ticket uses Jumpstarter-provisioned hardware.
Tool filtering ensures agents only see relevant device tools.

Usage in an agent's run() method:
    from agents.jumpstarter_mcp import attach_jumpstarter_mcp

    mcp = AgentMCPClient()
    await mcp.connect(...)  # agent's own servers
    await attach_jumpstarter_mcp(mcp, ticket_id, store_url)
