"""Gathering Context agent: dedup gate against Investigation Records.

Checks whether an incoming anomaly matches an open Investigation
Record. If matched, the agent appends a build_history entry and
skips the full investigation. If no match, proceeds to planning.

Only runs for investigation-mode tickets (those routed to
gathering_context by triage). Ad-hoc tickets never enter this
status and are unaffected.
