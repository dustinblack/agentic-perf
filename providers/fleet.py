"""Fleet investigation tracking for multi-host comparative testing.

Tracks which hosts have been tested during a fleet-wide investigation,
enabling the investigation loop-back to iterate through all available
devices of a given type.

Fleet investigations are ONLY available on the investigation path —
standard benchmark tickets cannot use fleet tracking. This is enforced
by checking for investigation context (anomaly_context or
investigation_ledger) before activating fleet features.
