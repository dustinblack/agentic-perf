"""Abstract interface for Investigation Record storage.

Any storage backend (file, OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, Horreum,
S3, PostgreSQL, etc.) implements this interface. Agents interact with
records through these methods, never with the backend directly.

Records are write-once: all investigation data (root cause,
confidence, operational metrics, change attribution) is set at
creation time and never modified. The only mutations allowed are:
- Appending build history entries (tracking regression across builds)
- Linking a Jira ticket (one-time, only if not already set)
- Closing the record (OPEN -> RESOLVED lifecycle transition)

This pattern follows the existing ResourceProvider abstraction in
providers/resource/base.py.
