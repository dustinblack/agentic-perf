# Jumpstarter Known Errors

## Driver Compatibility

**Error:** `doesn't match any of the allowed patterns`
or `driver not found`

**Cause:** The `j` CLI via socket does not read the client
config's `drivers.unsafe` setting. It defaults to
`unsafe=False` with an empty allow list, rejecting drivers
like `jumpstarter_driver_snmp` (used by QC8775 boards).
Can also indicate a version mismatch between client and
exporter.

**Fix:** The platform agent sets `drivers.unsafe=True`
via the client config. If the error persists, run
`scripts/setup-jumpstarter.sh` to reinstall drivers.

**IMPORTANT:** This error is FATAL — do not retry.

## Port 8080 Already In Use

**Error:** `[Errno 98] address already in use` on port 8080
during `j storage flash`

**Cause:** A previous flash operation left a stale HTTP
server process on the exporter host. This is an exporter-side
issue — the client cannot fix it.

**Fix:** The exporter administrator must kill the stale
process on the exporter host. Retrying or power cycling
will not help. Report the failure and request a different
board.

## Boot Failure Diagnosis via Serial Capture

Serial capture during the **benchmark phase** is handled
by the benchmark agent.  When a Jumpstarter lease is
active, the benchmark agent runs `j serial pipe` in the
background, saving output to `serial-capture.log` in the
run artifact directory.

**Note:** Serial capture is NOT available during the
**flash/provisioning phase**.  The flash tool requires
exclusive serial port access through the gRPC tunnel;
a concurrent serial pipe causes pexpect EOF.  Flash
diagnostics come from `flash-diagnostics.json` and the
exception chain in the tool result.

Common serial output patterns (from benchmark-phase
capture):

- **`ApplyOverlay: ufdt apply overlay failed`** — DTB
  overlay incompatibility. The kernel or DTB in the
  image does not match the board's firmware expectations.
  Requires a board-specific DTB overlay.
- **`Kernel panic`** — Kernel crash during boot. Check
  for driver incompatibilities or missing modules.
- **No output at all** — Board did not reach firmware
  stage. May indicate a flash failure or power issue.
- **Output stops at U-Boot** — Kernel failed to load.
  Check image format and partition layout.
- **`reboot: Power down`** — Sysboot health check
  failed, board powered itself off (see "Board Powers
  Off Shortly After Successful Provisioning" below).

Serial logs from the benchmark phase are saved as
artifacts in the run directory (e.g.
`PERF-XXXX/<run-id>/serial-capture.log`).  Flash-phase
diagnostics are at
`PERF-XXXX/platform-provision/flash-diagnostics.json`.

## Board Powers Off Shortly After Successful Provisioning

**Symptom:** Board is flashed, boots, SSH is verified, but
~2-3 minutes later the board powers off. Serial capture
shows `systemd-shutdown` followed by `reboot: Power down`.
No benchmark samples are collected.

**Serial indicators:**
- `Initramfs unpacking failed: Decoding failed`
- `reboot: Restarting system` (first boot auto-reboot)
- `reboot: Power down` (second boot gives up)
- `Invalid GPT` / `Can't read GPT header`

**Cause:** AutoSD uses **sysboot** for boot health checks
and **ukiboot** for A/B partition management. When the
initramfs is corrupted:

1. First boot: initramfs fails → sysboot health check
   fails → `FailureAction=reboot-force` → automatic reboot
2. Second boot: initramfs fails again →
   `tries_remaining` exhausted → no valid boot slot →
   system powers off

The board appears to boot successfully (reaches login,
SSH works) because the rootfs on disk is intact — but
sysboot detects the unhealthy initramfs and triggers the
A/B rollback mechanism. With a fresh flash there is no
slot B to fall back to, so it powers off.

**Diagnosis:** Check the benchmark-phase serial capture
(`serial-capture.log` in the run artifact directory) for
`Initramfs unpacking failed`. If present, the OS image
is corrupted or incompatible with this board.  For first-
boot failures before the benchmark runs, check
`flash-diagnostics.json` for the exception chain.

**This is NOT an agentic-perf or Jumpstarter issue.** The
problem is in the OS image build. Report to the image
build team with:
- The exact image URL from `jumpstarter_flash.flash_targets`
- The board type and firmware version from serial output
- The full provisioning serial log as evidence

**Timing signature:** The consistent ~170s kernel timestamp
on the shutdown (across different boards) is the sysboot
health check timeout + ukiboot retry exhaustion. If you
see `Power down` at roughly the same kernel time on
multiple boards with the same image, it confirms an image
problem rather than a board-specific hardware issue.

## Lease Cannot Be Satisfied

**Error:** `the lease cannot be satisfied`

**Cause:** No exporter matching the selector is available.
All matching devices may be leased by other users, offline,
or disabled.

**Fix:** Wait for a device to become available, or check
if the selector is correct via `list_jumpstarter_targets`.

## Exporter Disconnect During Provisioning

**Error:** `gRPC UNAVAILABLE: Stream removed (Socket closed)`
or `Connection to exporter lost: exporter is offline`

**Cause:** The Jumpstarter exporter's gRPC session drops
during or after a board reboot. This is a transient
condition — the exporter typically reconnects within
30-60 seconds.

**Recovery:** The provisioning code automatically retries
TCP address resolution with backoff (30s, 45s, 60s waits).
If all retries fail, the platform agent escalates to HITL.

**User action if HITL:** Retry — the exporter usually
recovers. If the board consistently fails, try a different
board of the same type.

## Failed to Get U-Boot Prompt

**Error:** `RuntimeError: Failed to get U-Boot prompt`
(often wrapped in `ExceptionGroup: unhandled errors in
a TaskGroup`)

**Cause:** The board did not reach the U-Boot bootloader
prompt after power cycle. This typically indicates a power
sequencing issue — the board needs a longer delay between
power off and power on to fully discharge capacitors and
reset the boot ROM.

**Fix:** Power cycle with a longer wait before retrying:
```
j power cycle --wait 180
```

The 180-second wait allows the board's power subsystem to
fully reset. After this extended power cycle, retry the
flash operation. This is a known issue with some NXP S32G
boards and Qualcomm SA8775P boards.

**For the platform agent:** When provisioning fails with
a U-Boot prompt error, retry with an extended power-off
delay (180s) before the next flash attempt. Do not
immediately retry with the default short delay.

## pexpect EOF During Flash (U-Boot Serial Connection Lost)

**Error:** `pexpect.exceptions.EOF: End Of File (EOF).
Empty string style platform.` with `searcher_string: 0: b'=>'`

**Cause:** The flash tool connects to the board's serial
console via a TCP port-forwarded gRPC tunnel.  During
`reboot_to_console()`, it sends ESC to interrupt U-Boot
autoboot and waits for the `=>` prompt.  EOF means the
serial TCP socket closed before the prompt appeared.

This is typically a **transient gRPC tunnel instability**,
not a board hardware problem.  When benchmark-phase
serial capture is available, U-Boot output usually shows
the autoboot countdown completing normally.

**Diagnosis:**
- Check `flash-diagnostics.json` for the unwrapped
  exception chain showing the full error path.
- If benchmark-phase `serial-capture.log` exists, check
  whether U-Boot reaches "Hit any key to stop autoboot"
  — if so, the board is healthy; the issue is the tunnel.
- Check `flash-diagnostics.json` — the unwrapped
  exception chain shows the full error path.
- The `BrokenResourceError` and `InvalidStateError:
  RPC already finished` messages in pod logs confirm
  gRPC tunnel drops.

**Fix:** Retry.  Transient gRPC instability usually
resolves on the next attempt.  If the error persists
across multiple boards and multiple attempts, escalate
to the Jumpstarter infrastructure team — the controller
or exporter networking may be degraded.

**This error is RETRYABLE** — do not treat it as
unrecoverable.  The flash tool's internal 4 retries may
not be enough if the gRPC tunnel is consistently
unstable during that window.

## ExceptionGroup / TaskGroup Errors

**Error:** `ExceptionGroup: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup
(1 sub-exception)`

**Cause:** This is a Python wrapper around the real error.
The actual cause is in the sub-exception. Common wrapped
errors include:
- `Failed to get U-Boot prompt` — power sequencing issue
- `Stream removed (Socket closed)` — exporter disconnect
- `Connection to exporter lost` — board went offline

**Diagnosis:** Check the full exception chain in the pod
logs or diagnostics. The sub-exception contains the
actionable information.
